    <h1 class="about">About me</h1>
    <p>I go by tokisuno online, and I am a content creator from Ontario, Canada. I am 22 years old, recently graduated with my BA in Linguistics, and am now self-learning web-development while I am unable to work! I make videos on whatever I find interesting, whether it be language learning or a new keyboard I got interested in.</p>

    <h3>Linguistics/Languages</h3>
    <p>I first got into language learning around the time I was in Grade 7-8, when someone I knew was planning on moving to Spain and was learning Spanish in preparation of that. I thought that was really intersting, but I felt a deep dread inside me because I was a Latino who couldn't speak any Spanish. He was using this "hip and cool" website called Duolingo and I decided to give it a try some months later. From there started an addiction, my addiction to knowing about language. For the next 5 years I either did one of three things in my classes. 1) I would watch a lot of YouTube (with one of my all-time favourites being Ludwig and Slime's Melee commentary highlights), 2) I would try to learn programming outside of class, and 3) I would spend copious amounts of time trying to learn about language learning and finding the "right language for me". I remember spending hours every single day trying to find the cheatcode to learning languages, and to find the easiest language for me to learn. It's funny because looking back at it, it's very cringe. I had came to the same conclusion almost daily, which ultimately had me wasting a lot of time doing anything BUT learning my target languages.</p>
    <p>I didn't want to go to University, but my parents told me I had to apply and go because "it was the right thing to do". So I applied to a few places for Computer Science/Programming adjacent programs, and then McMaster University for Linguistics as a joke. My dad's closest friend is a professor there, so I thought it would be funny. Turns out I spent over 4 years there LOL. Linguistics is fascinating, and the branch I found the most interesting was the formal side. This includes fields like Syntax, Semantics, and Morphology. I was sooo deep in the sauce that I thought I was going to be a Syntactician when I was older. I wanted to pursue academia and figure out the secrets to language. I justified this in my brain by saying "I can still do programming with the knowledge I have", "I can still contribute to Computational Linguistics with this, right?", without actually knowing anything. I let myself stay in ignorance in fear of getting an answer I didn't like. So later after giving it some more thought, I decided to drop the idea of pursuing a Masters and spend more time programming. I've distanced myself quite a bit from Linguistics over the past several months due to me just needing a break, but I still really enjoy Linguistics. I am just trying to find my footing in what I find most interesting. I am interested in Historical Linguistics (arguably the most interesting field), Sociolinguistics, Pragmatics, Semantics, Conlangs, and Forensic Linguistics</p>
